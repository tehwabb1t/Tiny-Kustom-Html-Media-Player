This is a basic html file made in gedit linking basic media player controls and user linked audio.
Very basic design with a small amount of code.
Read on and enjoy.


Design Steps  :

1 Create a folder on the desktop called KAudio
2 Inside this folder add a blank text file
3 Edit the text file using whatever text editor you like
4 Copy and paste the following code : 

	 <html>
	<body>
	<br> Kustom Media <br>
	<audio controls title=" Song Title Here ">
	<source src ="Song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
	</audio>
	</body>
	</html>

5 Save file as KA.html
6 Run the KA.html file and a browser should open up with a basic media display.
